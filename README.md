# React Expense Tracker

#### _Built With_

This Expense Tracker built with HTML, CSS, ReactJS, Bootstrap, and deployed with Heroku

## Basic Summary

This is my _first_ application built using the React framework. It has been a lot of fun to fully dig into learning the concept and implementation of new frameworks and dependencies. Throughout the process of creating this project, I've been able to really reinforce my knowledge of fundamental HTML and JavaScript, while seeing how different a framework like React acts and finding a new rhythm to my coding style.
